The debugging features have been added to the scrapeClubspot function:

1. ✅ Screenshots saved to debug_screenshots/ directory:
   - Initial page load
   - After waiting for content
   - Final state after extraction

2. ✅ URL tracking:
   - Logs every navigation event
   - Shows current URL and page title

3. ✅ Enhanced logging:
   - Page HTML length
   - Visible text sample
   - Selector matching results
   - Element processing details

NOTE: Console.log statements inside page.evaluate() won't show in server logs because they run in the browser context. The debug info is returned from evaluate() and logged outside instead.
